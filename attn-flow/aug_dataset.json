        "prompt": "Answer the question solely based on the context.\nContext:\n=== Development ===\nThe Wii MotionPlus was developed by Nintendo in collaboration with game development tool company AiLive. The sensor used is an InvenSense IDG-600 or IDG-650 in later units, designed in accordance to Nintendo's specification; with a high dynamic range, high mechanical shock tolerance, high temperature and humidity resistance, and small physical size.The Wii MotionPlus was conceived soon after the completion of the initial Wii Remote design, to address developer demand for more capable motion sensing, but was only announced after the sensors could be purchased in sufficient volume at a reasonable price.\n== History ==\nThe Wii MotionPlus was announced by Nintendo in a press release on July 14, 2008, and revealed the next day at a press conference at the E3 Media & Business Summit. It was released in June 2009. On May 3, 2010, Nintendo announced that starting May 9, 2010, the company would include its Wii Sports Resort game and MotionPlus controller with new consoles with no price increase.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe Wii MotionPlus was developed by Nintendo in collaboration with game development tool company AiLive.\nDuring a developer round table discussion at E3 2008, Wii Sports Resort producer Katsuya Eguchi discussed the potential influence of the Wii MotionPlus on the Wii's existing market, stating that Nintendo was looking at whether the MotionPlus capability will be built into the Wii Remote in the future, or kept \"as an attachment we only use for certain software.\"  Nintendo ultimately chose the former by releasing the Wii Remote Plus in late 2010.\n\n\n=== Colors and variants ===\nFrom June to August 2009, Club Nintendo in Japan held a contest wherein members who purchased and registered a copy of Wii Sports Resort would be entered into a draw to win a sky blue Wii MotionPlus in one of 5,000 blue controller sets. In November 2009, a black Wii MotionPlus was released to coincide with the release of the black Wii console.\nThe Wii MotionPlus (Wii\u30e2\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9) is an expansion device for the Wii Remote, the primary game controller for the Wii. The device allows more complex motion to be interpreted than the Wii Remote can do alone. Both the Wii and its successor, the Wii U, support the Wii MotionPlus accessory in  games.\nThe accessory was first released in June 2009. A later hardware revision of the Wii Remote, the Wii Remote Plus, was later released with the Wii MotionPlus technology built-in.\n== Reception ==\nDevelopers at Electronic Arts have noted that the fidelity of the device can be too sensitive and at times inaccurate, although technology reviewers have likened the improved accuracy as to the leap from the fidelity of VHS to that of Blu-ray.Game reviewers at Official Nintendo Magazine have called the device \"100% accurate\" and stated that movements are \"captured extremely accurately\".In North America, approximately 374,000 Wii MotionPlus units were sold in June 2009 (including nearly 205,000 units sold as part of a bundle with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10), according to the NPD Group.In Japan, the Wii MotionPlus sold approximately 650,000 units in its opening week (including units sold as part of a bundle with Wii Sports Resort), with about 296,000 sold as standalone units.\n\nQuestion:Wii MotionPlus is developed by\nAnswer is"

The remote Arctic island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard also form part of Norway. Bouvet Island, located in the Subantarctic, is a dependency; Norway also claims the Antarctic territories of Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land. The capital and largest city in Norway is Oslo.\nNorway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi) and had a population of 5,488,984 in January 2023. The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden. It is bordered by Finland and Russia to the northeast and the Skagerrak strait to the south.\nThe counties are then sub-divided into 357 second-level municipalities (kommuner), which in turn are administered by directly elected municipal council, headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet. The capital of Oslo is considered both a county and a municipality. Norway has two integral overseas territories out of mainland: Jan Mayen and Svalbard, the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name, located far to the north of the Norwegian mainland.96 settlements have city status in Norway. In most cases, the city borders are coterminous with the borders of their respective municipalities. Often, Norwegian city municipalities include large areas that are not developed.\nTraditional wooden buildings that were constructed in R\u00f8ros have survived.\n\nAfter Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital. The architect Christian H. Grosch designed the earliest parts of the University of Oslo, the Oslo Stock Exchange, and many other buildings and churches constructed in that early national period.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the city of \u00c5lesund was rebuilt in the Art Nouveau style, influenced by styles of France. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture. It is only since the late 20th century that Norwegian architects have achieved international renown. One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the S\u00e1mi Parliament in K\u00e1r\u00e1\u0161johka, designed by Stein Halvorson and Christian Sundby.\nIn 1993, Norway became the second country to legalise civil union partnerships for same-sex couples, and on 1 January 2009, Norway became the sixth country to legalise same-sex marriage. As a promoter of human rights, Norway has held the annual Oslo Freedom Forum conference, a gathering described by The Economist as \"on its way to becoming a human-rights equivalent of the Davos economic forum\".\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nNorway maintains embassies in 82 countries. 60 countries maintain an embassy in Norway, all of them in the capital, Oslo.\nNorway is a founding member of the United Nations (UN), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Council of Europe and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).\n== Economy ==\n\nNorwegians enjoy the second-highest GDP per capita among European countries (after Luxembourg), and the sixth-highest GDP (PPP) per capita in the world. Norway ranks as the second-wealthiest country in monetary value, with the largest capital reserve per capita of any nation. According to the CIA World Factbook, Norway is a net external creditor of debt. Norway reclaimed first place in the world in the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) in 2009. The standard of living in Norway is among the highest in the world. Foreign Policy magazine ranks Norway last in its Failed States Index for 2009 and 2023, judging Norway to be the world's most well-functioning and stable country.\n\nQuestion:Norway's capital,\nAnswer is"

The show followed a similar format to its Maria and Joseph predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in a West End production of Lionel Bart's Oliver!, a musical based on the Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist. The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character's role, but the show's main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by Jodie Prenger despite Lloyd Webber's stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate.\n=== 2010s ===\nFollowing the opening of Love Never Dies, Lloyd Webber again began a search for a new musical theatre performer in the BBC One series Over the Rainbow. He cast the winner, Danielle Hope, in the role of Dorothy Gale, and a dog to play Toto in his forthcoming stage production of The Wizard of Oz. He and lyricist and composer Tim Rice wrote a number of new songs for the production to supplement the songs from the film.\nOn 1 March 2011, The Wizard of Oz opened at The Palladium Theatre, starring Hope as Dorothy Gale and Michael Crawford as the Wizard of Oz. In 2012, Lloyd Webber fronted a new ITV primetime show Superstar which gave the UK public the chance to decide who would play the starring role of Jesus in an arena tour of Jesus Christ Superstar.\n== Personal life ==\nLloyd Webber has been married three times. He married first Sarah Hugill on 24 July 1971; they divorced on 14 November 1983.

They divorced on 3 January 1990, but have remained close friends and have also continued to work together.Thirdly, he married Madeleine Gurdon in Westminster on 9 February 1991.\nIt ran for 19 months and 500 performances. A revised production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 17 November 2005. Garnering mixed reviews from critics, due in part to the frequent absences of the show's star Maria Friedman due to breast cancer treatment, it closed only a brief three months later on 19 February 2006.Lloyd Webber produced a staging of The Sound of Music, which d\u00e9buted in November 2006. He made the controversial decision to choose an unknown to play leading lady Maria, who was found through the BBC's reality television show How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, in which he was a judge.

In 1968 he composed and conducted the score for director Harrison Engle's minimalist comedy short, Railroaded, played by the Philip Glass Ensemble. This was one of his earliest film efforts.\nThe year after scoring Hamburger Hill (1987), Glass began a long collaboration with the filmmaker Errol Morris with his music for Morris's celebrated documentaries, including The Thin Blue Line (1988) and A Brief History of Time (1991).\nPhilip Glass (born January 31, 1937) is an American composer and pianist. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century.  Glass's work has been associated with minimalism, being built up from repetitive phrases and shifting layers. Glass describes himself as a composer of \"music with repetitive structures\", which he has helped to evolve stylistically.Glass founded the Philip Glass Ensemble, which is still in existence, but Glass no longer performs with the ensemble. He has written 15 operas, numerous chamber operas and musical theatre works, 14 symphonies, 12 concertos, nine string quartets, various other chamber music pieces, and many film scores. Three of his film scores have been nominated for Academy Awards.\nIn August 2011, Glass presented a series of music, dance, and theater performances as part of the Days and Nights Festival. Along with the Philip Glass Ensemble, scheduled performers include Molissa Fenley and Dancers, John Moran with Saori Tsukada, as well as a screening of Dracula with Glass's score.Other works completed since 2010 include Symphony No. 9 (2010\u20132011), Symphony No. 10 (2012), Cello Concerto No. 2 (2012, based on the film score to Naqoyqatsi) as well as String Quartet No. 6 and No. 7. Glass's Ninth Symphony was co-commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, the American Composers Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.\nAfter Play, Glass also acted in 1966 as music director of a Breuer production of Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children, featuring the theatre score by Paul Dessau.\nIn parallel with his early excursions in experimental theatre, Glass worked in winter 1965 and spring 1966 as a music director and composer on a film score (Chappaqua, Conrad Rooks, 1966) with Ravi Shankar and Alla Rakha, which added another important influence on Glass's musical thinking. His distinctive style arose from his work with Shankar and Rakha and their perception of rhythm in Indian music as being entirely additive.\nIt was all intricacy, exotic harmonics\". In 1970, Glass returned to the theatre, composing music for the theatre group Mabou Mines, resulting in his first minimalist pieces employing voices: Red Horse Animation and Music for Voices (both 1970, and premiered at the Paula Cooper Gallery).After differences of opinion with Steve Reich in 1971, Glass formed the Philip Glass Ensemble (while Reich formed Steve Reich and Musicians), an amplified ensemble including keyboards, wind instruments (saxophones, flutes), and soprano voices.\n\nQuestion:Philip Glass plays the\nAnswer is"

He began his training in finance at a young age and his father put him in charge of the bank's gold bullion operations.\nDuring the 1860s, great debates raged across Europe and the United States as to an appropriate monetary system for the changing times. In France, the prominent  P\u00e9reire brothers bankers were proponents of paper money in contrast to Alphonse de Rothschild who defended preservation of France's bimetallism system.\nAlphonse was educated to take his place at the head of France's de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res bank, training in the other Rothschild banking houses in Europe.

They had four children. Their firstborn, Bettina Caroline (1858\u20131892), married Albert Salomon von Rothschild.\nNathaniel's Mouton vineyard received a second-growth ranking in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. Just three months before their father died in 1868, Alphonse and Gustave convinced him to buy the more prestigious First Growth Ch\u00e2teau Lafite vineyard in Pauillac when it came up for sale.\nOn the death of their father in 1868, Alphonse and Gustave inherited the Ch\u00e2teau Lafite-Rothschild vineyard. However, they lived in Paris and the vineyard was not significant relative to their massive investments in banking and other business ventures. As such, they only visited the Pauillac vineyard occasionally, maintaining little more than an arms-length interest. On their deaths, the Rothschild brothers willed the property to a son and it remains in family hands to this day.\n\nQuestion:Alphonse James de Rothschild died in\nAnswer is"

Liszt played \"Au bord d'une source\" from Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage, as well as his arrangement of Schubert's Ave Maria for the musicians.

Liszt also said: \"It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent\".

After the Great Fire of Hamburg in May 1842, he gave concerts in aid of those left homeless.During a tour of Ukraine in 1847, Liszt played in Kiev, where he met the Polish Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. For some time he had been considering retiring from the life of a travelling virtuoso to concentrate on composition, and at this point he made the decision to take up a court position in Weimar. Having known Liszt for only a few weeks, Carolyne resolved to join him there.\nMany witnesses later testified that Liszt's playing raised the mood of audiences to a level of mystical ecstasy.It is estimated that Liszt appeared in public well over one thousand times during this eight-year period. Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time.Adding to his reputation was that Liszt gave away much of the proceeds of his work to charity and humanitarian causes. He donated large sums to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral and St. Stephen's Basilica in Pest, and made private donations to public services such as hospitals and schools, as well as charitable organizations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund.\nIn 1860 he settled in Rome, and took up the work of winning acceptance for the best German music, then little known in Italy. The influence and support of Franz Liszt, who was in Rome from 1861, was naturally of great advantage to him, and concerts were given in which Sgambati conducted as well as playing the piano.His compositions at this period (1864\u20131865) included a quartet, two piano quintets, an octet, and an overture.

With the funds from the \"Yemeni Treasury\" Aisha set out on a campaign against the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali.Aisha, along with an army including Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, confronted Ali's army, demanding the prosecution of Uthman's killers who had mingled with his army outside the city of Basra. When her forces captured Basra she ordered the execution of 600 Muslims and 40 others, including Hakim ibn Jabala, who were put to death in the Grand Mosque of Basra.\n== Early life ==\nAisha was born in Mecca c.\u2009613\u2013614. She was the daughter of Abu Bakr and Umm Ruman, two of Muhammad's most trusted companions. No sources offer much more information about Aisha's childhood years.\n\n\n=== Marriage to Muhammad ===\nThe idea to match Aisha with Muhammad was suggested by Khawlah bint Hakim after the death of Muhammad's first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid. After this, the previous agreement regarding the marriage of Aisha with Jubayr ibn Mu\u1e6d\u02bdim was put aside by common consent. Abu Bakr was uncertain at first \"as to the propriety or even legality of marrying his daughter to his 'brother'.\" Muhammad responded that they were brothers only in religion.\nThe city continued to oppose \u2018Uthm\u0101n, but as for Aisha, her journey to Mecca was approaching. With the journey to Mecca approaching at this time, she wanted to rid herself of the situation. \u2018Uthm\u0101n heard of her not wanting to hurt him, and he asked her to stay because she influenced the people, but this did not persuade Aisha, and she continued on her journey.\n\n\n=== First Fitna ===\n\nIn 655, Uthman's house was put under siege by about 1000 rebels. Eventually the rebels broke into the house and murdered Uthman, provoking the First Fitna. After killing Uthman, the rebels asked Ali to be the new caliph, although Ali was not involved in the murder of Uthman according to many reports.\nUpon her arrival in Medina, Aisha retired from her public role in politics. Her discontinuation of public politics did not stop her political influence completely. Privately, Aisha continued influencing those intertwined in the Islamic political sphere. Among the Islamic community, she was known as an intelligent woman who debated law with male companions. Aisha was also considered to be the embodiment of proper rituals while partaking in the pilgrimage to Mecca, a journey she made with several groups of women. For the last two years of her life, Aisha spent much of her time telling the stories of Muhammad, hoping to correct false passages that had become influential in formulating Islamic law. Due to this, Aisha's political influence continues to impact Muslims.\nHer intellectual contributions regarding the verbal texts of Islam were in time transcribed into written form, becoming the official history of Islam. After the death of Muhammad, Aisha was regarded as the most reliable source in the teachings of hadith. Aisha's authentication of Muhammad's ways of prayer and his recitation of the Qur'an allowed for the development of knowledge of his sunnah of praying and reading verses of the Quran.\n\n\n=== Political influence ===\nSpellberg argues that Aisha's political influence helped promote her father, Abu Bakr, to the caliphate after Muhammad's death.After the defeat at the Battle of the Camel, Aisha retreated to Medina and became a teacher. Upon her arrival in Medina, Aisha retired from her public role in politics. Her discontinuation of public politics did not stop her political influence completely.\n\nQuestion:Aisha originates from the city of\nAnswer is"

Operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and covering 7,627 acres (3,087 ha), O'Hare has non-stop flights to 214 destinations in North America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Oceania, and the North Atlantic region as of November 2022.\nBy 1960, the need for O'Hare as an active duty fighter base was diminishing, just as commercial business was picking up at the airport. The Air Force removed active-duty units from O'Hare and turned the station over to Continental Air Command, enabling them to base reserve and Air National Guard units there. As a result of a 1993 agreement between the City and the Department of Defense, the reserve base was closed on April 1, 1997, ending its career as the home of the 928th Airlift Wing and of the 126th Air Refueling Wing in 1999. At that time, the remaining 357-acre (144 ha) site came under the ownership of the Chicago Department of Aviation.\nAs of 2023, O'Hare is considered the world's most connected airport.Designed to be the successor to Chicago's Midway International Airport, itself once nicknamed the \"busiest square mile in the world,\" O'Hare began as an airfield serving a Douglas manufacturing plant for C-54 military transports during World War II. It was renamed Orchard Field Airport in the mid-1940s and assigned the IATA code ORD. In 1949, it was renamed after aviator Edward \"Butch\" O'Hare, the U.S. Navy's first Medal of Honor recipient during that war.\nNorthwest likewise ceded O'Hare to the competition and shifted to a Minneapolis/St. Paul and Detroit-centered network by the early 1990s after acquiring Republic Airlines in 1986. Delta maintained an O'Hare hub for some time, even commissioning a new Concourse L in 1983. Ultimately, Delta found competing from an inferior position at O'Hare too expensive and closed its Chicago hub in the 1990s, concentrating its upper Midwest operations at Cincinnati.\n\nThe dominant hubs established at O'Hare in the 1980s by United and American continue to operate today.

Teller was known for his scientific ability, difficult interpersonal relations, and volatile personality.Born in Austria-Hungary in 1908, Teller emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, one of the many so-called \"Martians\", a group of prominent Hungarian scientist \u00e9migr\u00e9s. He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (in particular the Jahn\u2013Teller and Renner\u2013Teller effects), and surface physics.\nHe chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development\u2014in fact, he stepped down from the directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.Teller established the Department of Applied Science at the University of California, Davis and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1963, which holds the Edward Teller endowed professorship in his honor.

The device has a 2-point multi-touch colour LCD screen with a diagonal length of 7 inches (180 mm) and a 600\u00d71024-pixel resolution (160 dpi density). Connectivity is through 802.11n Wi-Fi and USB 2.0 (Micro-B connector).\n== History ==\nThe Kindle Fire\u2014which includes access to the Amazon Appstore, streaming movies and TV shows, and the Kindle Store for e-books\u2014was released to consumers in the United States on November 14, 2011, after being announced on September 28.The original Kindle Fire retailed for US$199 in 2011.\nEstimates of the device's initial bill of materials cost ranged from $150 to $202. Amazon's business strategy was stated in 2011 as making money through sales of digital content on the Fire, rather than through sales of the device itself.On September 6, 2012, the Kindle Fire was upgraded to the second generation, and its price was reduced to US$159, RAM upgraded to 1 GB and processor clock speed upgraded to 1.2 GHz.\nOn September 7, 2012, upgrades to the device were announced with consumer availability to those European countries with a localised version of Amazon's website (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain).As of October 2012, the Kindle Fire was the second best selling tablet after Apple's iPad, with about 7 million units sold according to estimates by Forrester Research and as of 2013 Amazon's tablets were the fourth best selling.The Fire tablet line was not updated until 2015; Amazon only released Fire HD and Fire HDX tablets during that time. In 2015 Amazon made a full refresh of their tablet family where they brought the range down market as a series of budget focused devices, returning to the lower-spec Fire line and cancelling the HDX line.\nWith this development the company aims to introduce new user features such as a system-wide dark mode.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAnalysts had projected the device to be a strong competitor to Apple's iPad, and that other Android device makers would suffer lost sales.In a 2012 review published by Project Gutenberg, the Kindle Fire was called a \"huge step back in freedom from the Kindle 3\"; the reviewer noted that Amazon introduced a \"deliberate limitation\" into the Fire that didn't exist in the previous version: it is no longer possible to download free e-books from websites such as Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive and Google Books and have them stored permanently in the same places where books from Amazon are kept.\n\nQuestion:Kindle Fire, created by\nAnswer is"

Fourth single from her fourth album Anamorphos\u00e9e, it was released on 1 July 1996. It was a relative failure: indeed, it failed to reach the top ten in France and was the least-selling single from the album.\n== Lyrics and music ==\nJournalist Beno\u00eet Cachin said \"Comme j'ai mal\" seems to be as \"a confession and may be related to the texts of \"Ainsi soit je...\" and \"Laisse le vent emporter tout\"\". Farmer evokes \"her pain of living that prevents her from enjoying life\"; she also talks about her lucidity and disillusionment and \"that leads her to disconnect both physically and psychologically from the real world for a better world that belongs to her\". Author Erwan Chuberre considered that with this song, Farmer keeps up with lyrics \"evoking death and the escape from reality\". According to psychologist Hugues Royer, the song contains \"the sign of a hope of change\" of the malaise from childhood, \"of a travel for the mind and the body\".\n== Promotion and chart performance ==\nOn the television, Farmer performed \"Comme j'ai mal\" on the Tip Top show, broadcast on TF1 on 24 October 1996. Just after her performance, she sang \"La Poup\u00e9e qui fait non\", a song originally composed by Michel Polnareff, as duet with Khaled. Regarding tours, the song was performed on the 1996 Live \u00e0 Bercy tour; Farmer sang it alone in the middle of the stage illuminated by many lights.

The Latin Empire was intended to replace the Byzantine Empire as the Western-recognized Roman Empire in the east, with a Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. The main objective of the Latin Empire was planned by Venice, which promoted the creation of this state for their self-benefit.The Fourth Crusade had originally been called to retake the Muslim-controlled city of Jerusalem, but a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army sacking the city of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire.\nAs for the rest of Hispania, Latin law was granted to all cities under the reign of Vespasian (69\u201379 AD), while Roman citizenship was granted to all free men of the empire by the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of Roman law since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, wine, wheat), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the Via Augusta, parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like aqueducts.\nConversion to Christianity, attested in the 3rd century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th century.\nWith the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 AD by Odoacer, the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed. The Eastern Roman Empire survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital, until the city's fall in 1453.Due to the Empire's extent and endurance, its institutions and culture had a lasting influence on the development of language, religion, art, architecture, literature, philosophy, law, and forms of government across its territories. Latin evolved into the Romance languages while Medieval Greek became the language of the East. The Empire's adoption of Christianity resulted in the formation of medieval Christendom. Roman and Greek art had a profound impact on the Italian Renaissance.\nIts capital and largest city is Rome.\nIn antiquity, the Italian peninsula was home to numerous peoples; the Latin city of Rome in central Italy, founded as a Kingdom, became a Republic that conquered the Mediterranean world and ruled it for centuries as an Empire. With the spread of Christianity, Rome became the seat of the Catholic Church and of the Papacy. During the Early Middle Ages, Italy experienced the fall of the Western Roman Empire and inward migration from Germanic tribes. By the 11th century, Italian city-states and maritime republics expanded, bringing renewed prosperity through commerce and laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. The Italian Renaissance flourished in Florence during the 15th and 16th centuries and spread to the rest of Europe. Italian explorers also discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, leading the European Age of Discovery.\n=== In Europe ===\nUnlike in Asia, where the Latin Empire faced only an initially weak Nicaea, in Europe it was immediately confronted with a powerful enemy: the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan. When Baldwin campaigned against the Byzantine lords of Thrace, they called upon Kaloyan for help. At the Battle of Adrianople on 14 April 1205, the Latin heavy cavalry and knights were crushed by Kaloyan's troops and Cuman allies, and Emperor Baldwin was captured. He was imprisoned in the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo until his death later in 1205.\n\nQuestion:Latin Empire's capital,\nAnswer is"

Selim was enraged by the Shah's denigration of his literary talent and ordered the Persian envoy to be torn to pieces.Outside of their military conflicts, Selim I and Shah Ismail clashed on the economic front as well. Opposed to Shah Ismail's adherence to the Shia sect of Islam (contrasting his Sunni beliefs), Selim I and his father before him \"did not really accept his basic political and religious legitimacy,\" beginning the portrayal of the Safavids in Ottoman chronicles as kuffar. After the Battle of Chaldiran, Selim I's minimal tolerance for Shah Ismail disintegrated, and he began a short era of closed borders with the Safavid Empire.\n=== Conquest of the Middle East ===\n\n\n==== Safavid Empire ====\n\nOne of Selim's first challenges as sultan involved the growing tension between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid Empire led by Shah Ismail, who had recently brought the Safavids to power and had switched the Persian state religion from Sunni Islam to adherence to the Twelver branch of Shia Islam. By 1510 Ismail had conquered the whole of Iran and Azerbaijan, southern Dagestan (with its important city of Derbent), Mesopotamia, Armenia, Khorasan, Eastern Anatolia, and had made the Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti his vassals. He was a great threat to his Sunni Muslim neighbors to the west.\nOfficially, it is said that Selim succumbed to a mistreated carbuncle. Some historians, however, suggest that he died of cancer or that his physician poisoned him. Other historians have noted that Selim's death coincided with a period of plague in the empire, and have added that several sources imply that Selim himself suffered from the disease.\nOn 22 September 1520 Selim I's eight-year reign came to an end. Selim died and was brought to Istanbul, so he could be buried in Yavuz Selim Mosque which sultan Suleiman I commissioned in loving memory of his father. Selim I had conquered and unified the Islamic holy lands.

In 1511 Ismail had supported a pro-Shia/Safavid uprising in Anatolia, the \u015eahkulu Rebellion.\nEarly in his reign, Selim created a list of all Shiites ages 7 to 70 in a number of central Anatolian cities including Tokat, Sivas and Amasya. As Selim marched through these cities, his forces rounded up and executed all the Shiites they could find. Most of them were beheaded. The massacre was the largest in Ottoman history, until the end of the 19th century.In 1514 Selim I attacked Ismail's kingdom to stop the spread of Shiism into Ottoman dominions.

In 1860 he settled in Rome, and took up the work of winning acceptance for the best German music, then little known in Italy.\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nGiovanni Angelo Braschi was born in Cesena on Christmas Day in 1717 as the eldest of eight children to Count Marco Aurelio Tommaso Braschi and Anna Teresa Bandi. His siblings were Felice Silvestro, Giulia Francesca, Cornelio Francesco, Maria Olimpia, Anna Maria Costanza, Giuseppe Luigi and Maria Lucia Margherita. His maternal grandmother was Countess Cornelia Zangheri Bandi. He was baptized in Cesena two days later on 27 December and was given the baptismal name of Angelo Onofrio Melchiorre Natale Giovanni Antonio.After completing his studies in the Jesuit college of Cesena and receiving his doctorate of both canon and civil law in 1734, Braschi continued his studies at the University of Ferrara.\nHis many pianoforte works have won permanent success. Sgambati was also active in the contemporary musical scene as a promoter of the music of others and, among these, Dante Alderighi. He conducted the Italian premieres of Beethoven's third and of seventh symphonies (in 1867 and 1870 respectively). He also conducted the Italian premieres of more recent works such as Liszt's Dante Symphony and Christus oratorio.He died in Rome, aged 73.

He was son of Giovanni Battista Vivaldi and Camilla Calicchio, as recorded in the register of San Giovanni in Bragora.He was baptized immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife, the reason for which has led to speculation. Most likely it was done due either to his poor health or to an earthquake that supposedly struck the city that day. In the trauma of the earthquake, Vivaldi's mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood. However, there was no earthquake on the day Vivaldi was born, and this rumor may originate from an earthquake that struck Venice on 17 April 1688.\nAfter his death in 1903, he was buried in the Vatican Grottoes before his remains were later transferred in 1924 to the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.\n\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\nBorn in Carpineto Romano, near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven children of Count Ludovico Pecci (1767\u20131833) and his wife, Anna Francesca Prosperi Buzzi (1773\u20131824). His brothers included Giuseppe and Giovanni Battista Pecci.

It is the only seminary affiliated with Reconstructionist Judaism.  It is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.  RRC has an enrollment of approximately 80 students in rabbinic and other graduate programs.A 2012 restructuring of the Reconstructionist movement's institutions left RRC as the primary organization of the movement, headed by Rabbi Deborah Waxman. This central organization changed its name to \"Reconstructing Judaism\" in January 2018. \u2014 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College remains part of this organization.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe goal was that students be aware of general trends in the study of religion and of other religious traditions. This \u201cdual program\u201d proved difficult to complete, as most students were enrolled in two graduate programs while also working part-time.  The initial doctoral requirement was eventually reduced to a secular master's degree.\nThe Reconstructionist Rabbinical College also recognized that future rabbis needed preparation in addition to purely academic courses and text studies.  From the early years of RRC there were courses in practical rabbinics, covering such issues as pastoral counseling and life cycle events.  In more recent years these have expanded to a multi-tiered program of practical rabbinics that includes coursework, supervised field internships, group supervision, and a requirement to shadow religious leaders in the field.\nThe RRC curriculum continues to be based on its civilizational approach.  In addition, the college focuses on developing community and integrating spiritual growth with academic studies.In 2011 Sandra Lawson became the first openly gay African-American and the first African-American admitted to RRC.In 2013 Rabbi Deborah Waxman was elected as the President of RRC.  As the President, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary.In 2015 RRC voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners.\n\n\n== Academics ==\nRRC is a graduate institution.\nAt the FRCH conference in Montreal in June, 1967, the delegates overwhelmingly called for the establishment of a school for training rabbis.\nThe college opened in 1968 based in two brownstone buildings at 2308 North Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, near Temple University.From its founding, RRC had two unique features in its curriculum. First, based on the Reconstructionist concept of an \u201cevolving religious civilization\u201d the five-year curriculum was centered on a historical period each year. These were biblical, rabbinic, medieval, modern (roughly to 1948), and contemporary periods.  During each year, students would focus on the history, texts, and concepts of that period. With modifications, this developmental approach continues as a central feature of the RRC curriculum.\nApproximately half the graduates serve congregations (Reconstructionist, those affiliated with other movements, or unaffiliated.)  Others serve in academia, in Hillel and campus positions, as civilian and military chaplains, educators, in Jewish agencies, or are employed by the Reconstructionist movement.  About one-fifth work in other areas, including as authors, editors, researchers, spiritual counselors, independent rabbis, or are retired. RRC graduates serve Jewish communities in the US, Canada, Australia, France, and Israel.\n\n\n== College centers ==\nThe College sponsored three program centers, of which The Center for Jewish Ethics is still in operation:\n\nQuestion:Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is affiliated with the religion of\nAnswer is"

It was authored by Khalil Ahmad al-Saharanpuri (d.\nThe Deobandi movement or Deobandism is a revivalist movement within Sunni Islam that adheres to the Hanafi school of law. It formed in the late 19th century around the Darul Uloom Madrassa in Deoband, India, from which the name derives, by Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, and several others, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857\u201358. They opposed influence of non-Muslim cultures on the Muslim of South Asia. The movement pioneered education in religious sciences through the Dars-i-Nizami associated with the Lucknow-based ulama of Firangi Mahal with the goal of preserving traditional Islamic teachings from the influx of modernist, secular ideas during British colonial rule.\nDehlawi was a contemporary of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703 - 1792), and they studied in Medina under some of the same teachers, despite having different theological backgrounds. According to Muhammad Iqbal, Deobandiyat is neither a creed (mathab) nor a sect \u2013 terms by which its antagonists try to incite the masses against it \u2013 but it is a comprehensive picture and a complete edition of the tack of the Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama\u2019ah in which all the offshoots of the Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama\u2019ah are seen joined with their root.\n\n\n=== Theology ===\nIn tenets of faith, the Deobandis follow the Maturidi school of Islamic theology.\nHowever most Deobandi leaders incorporate elements of sober Sufism into their practices and believe it to be a fundamental part of the religion.\nDeoband's curriculum combined the study of Islamic holy scriptures (Quran, hadith and law) with rational subjects (logic, philosophy and science). At the same time it was hugely Sufi in orientation and affiliated with the Chisti order. Taqi Usmani - the most famous Deobandi scholar was trained in the Chishti order as were the four founders of the Deoband madrassa. Mahmood Ashraf Usmani, the former head of Darul Ulum Karachi, defended the concept of tariqas and bayah based on the Pledge of the Tree incident.\n=== Sufism ===\n\nKhalil Ahmad al-Saharanpuri outlined the creedal beliefs of Deobandis in his Al-Muhannad ala al-Mufannad where he stated that\n\nHowever despite this, Deobandis argue for a reformed version of Sufism. They generally oppose folklore based Sufi practices such as excessive celebrations of the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and seeking help from him, the celebration of Urs, pilgrimage to the shrines of Sufi saints, practice of Sema, and loud dhikr - seeing them as too esoteric in nature.

The series follows the endeavors of master thief Lupin III, grandson of gentleman thief Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, joined by his criminal gang. The original Lupin III manga began in Weekly Manga Action on August 10, 1967. \nOver fifty years after its creation, Lupin III remains popular, with a seventh anime series airing in 2021 and new ONAs released in 2023. Critical reception of the franchise has been largely positive across its various incarnations, with the appeal of the lead characters being noted as the primary factor of the series' success.\nMonkey Punch stated that using the same character design, behavior, and face would be illegal, but using a name alone is not illegal. In 2012, Leblanc's original Ars\u00e8ne Lupin entered the public domain in France due to 70 years passing since his death in 1941, and is in the public domain for any country that enforces the rule of the shorter term.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Manga ===\n\nLupin III was written and illustrated by Monkey Punch. It was serialized by Futabasha in Weekly Manga Action in 94 chapters from August 10, 1967. Additional chapters known as Lupin III New Adventures were released from August 12, 1971.\nFrom August 10 to August 22, 2011, over 300 items related to Lupin III were exhibited, including original manuscripts by Monkey Punch and animation cels from the feature films. The following year a similar exhibit was held at the Kitakyushu museum from November 3 to December 28, and another at the Kawasaki City Museum from October until November 10, 2013. The exhibit then moved to Aomori's Sunroad shopping centre from December 21, 2013, until January 21, 2014.In 2012, the Hokkaido Railway Company unveiled Lupin III\u2013themed trains on their Hanasaki Line between Kushiro and Nemuro station, in honor of Monkey Punch, who is a native of Hokkaido.\nBefore creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc's stories. The aim of the Lupin III series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of Leblanc's character. Originally the intention was to keep the blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however, he was convinced by others not to do so.Monkey Punch combined elements of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin with James Bond to develop the character of Lupin III and made him a \"carefree fellow\". Lupin was given a red color jacket which Monkey Punch believed was a flashy, sexy color.As the series was to be published in a magazine targeted at adults, Fujiko Mine was created to add a female presence and to fulfill a \"Bond girl\" role.\nThe Pilot Film was created by Sugii, Yasuo Otsuka, Tsutomu Shibayama and Osamu Kobayashi, with supervision by Masaaki \u014csumi. Completed in 1969, the project was left unsold and the Pilot Film was adapted for television when Yomiuri Television agreed to broadcast and provide funding for a televised animated adaptation of the manga in 1971.Since then, several animated films based on Lupin III have been created by TMS Entertainment.\nThe Lupin III franchise also crossed over with City Hunter in City Hunter The Movie: Angel Dust, released on September 8, 2023.\n\n\n=== Original video animations ===\nSeveral original video animations (OVAs) based on Lupin III have been produced.\n\nQuestion:Lupin III was created in the country of his birth,\nAnswer is"

Since 2018, Clarkson has hosted the ITV game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.\nFrom a career as a local journalist in northern England, Clarkson rose to public prominence as a presenter of the original format of Top Gear in 1988. Since the mid-1990s, he has become a recognised public personality, regularly appearing on British television presenting his own shows for BBC and appearing as a guest on other shows. As well as motoring, Clarkson has produced programmes and books on subjects such as history and engineering.\nHe famously left with one C and two U (fail) grades at A level. Clarkson attended Repton alongside Formula One engineer Adrian Newey and former Top Gear Executive Producer Andy Wilman.\nHe played the role of a preparatory school pupil, Atkinson, in a BBC radio Children's Hour serial adaptation of Anthony Buckeridge's Jennings novels until his voice broke.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Writing career ===\nClarkson's first job was as a travelling salesman for his parents' business, selling Paddington Bear toys.\nHe later trained as a journalist with the Rotherham Advertiser, before also writing for the Rochdale Observer, Wolverhampton Express and Star, Lincolnshire Life, Shropshire Star and the Associated Kent Newspapers.\n\"In 1984, Clarkson formed the Motoring Press Agency (MPA), in which, with fellow motoring journalist Jonathan Gill, he conducted road tests for local newspapers and automotive magazines.

He has written humorous books about cars and several other subjects, with many of his books being collections of articles that he has written for The Sunday Times.\nSome critics even attribute Clarkson's actions and views as being influential enough to be responsible for the closure of Rover and the Luton manufacturing plant of Vauxhall. Clarkson's comments about Rover prompted workers to hang an \"Anti-Clarkson Campaign\" banner outside the defunct Longbridge plant in its last days.\nThe BBC often played down his comments as ultimately not having the weight they were ascribed. In 2007, they described Clarkson as \"not a man given to considered opinion\", and in response to an official complaint another BBC spokeswoman once said: \"Jeremy's colourful comments are always entertaining, but they are his own comments and not those of the BBC. More often than not they are said with a twinkle in his eye.\nIn October 2005, Clarkson visited British troops in Baghdad.In 2003, Clarkson presented The Victoria Cross: For Valour, looking at recipients of the Victoria Cross, in particular focusing on his father-in-law, Robert Henry Cain, who received a VC for actions during the Battle of Arnhem in World War II.In 2007, Clarkson wrote and presented Jeremy Clarkson: Greatest Raid of All Time, a documentary about the World War II Operation Chariot, a 1942 Commando raid on the docks of Saint-Nazaire in occupied France.
